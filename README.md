# BuddyBank

This project is being setup on Windows 10, so it will probably be a bit non-standard. That being said, I aim to make it as easy to setup and start running as possible

Instructions

Requirements
1. Requires a sql database
2. In the resources folder, there is an application.scrubbed file. Copy and rename it in the same folder to application.properties (adjusting any that you want)
